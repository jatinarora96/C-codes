	Interpolation is used to solve problems from the more general area of approximatiopn theory.

	Interpolation is one of important tools in producing computable approximatins to commonly used functions.

	One of the methods to implement interpolation is LEGRANGE'S METHOD. 

	This method is the most clever construction of the interpolating polynomial Pn(x), and leads directly to an analytical formula. 

	The Lagrange polynomial is the sum of n + 1 terms and each term is itself a polynomial of degree n. 

	The fullpolynomial is therefore of degree n. Counting from 0, the ith term of the Lagrange polynomial is constructed by

	requiring it to be zero at xj with j not equal to i, and equal to yi when j = i. 

	Pn(x) = (x - x1)(x - x2) . . . (x - xn)y0)                 
                ____________________________________   +            
                (x0 - x1)(x0 - x2) . . . (x0 - xn)         

		(x - x0)(x - x2) . . . (x - xn)y1                (x - x0)(x - x1) . . . (x - xn-1)yn
		__________________________________ + . . . +     ____________________________________
		(x1 - x0)(x1 - x2) . . . (x1 - xn)               (xn - x0)(xn - x1) . . . (xn - xn-1)

	It can be clearly seen that the first term is equal to zero when x = x1, x2, . . . , xn and equal to y0 when x = x0; 
	
	the second term is equal to zero when x = x0, x2, . . . xn and equal to y1 when x = x1;
 
	and the last term is equal to zero when x = x0, x1, . . . xn-1 and equal to yn when x = xn.
 
        The uniqueness of the interpolating polynomial implies that the Lagrange polynomial must be the interpolating 

	polynomial.
