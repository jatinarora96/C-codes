This folder contains my entire Project which is coded in C.
The aim of the project is to provide the Numerical Solutions to the Mathematical equations. The Numerical Solutions are based on Numerical Methods.
Some of the Numerical methods which have been implemented here are: Regression(Linear, Polynomial), Root Finding(Closed, Open Methods), Interpolation(Newton's,Legrange's method), Integration(, solution to Linear Equation.
