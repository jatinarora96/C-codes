	NEWTON'S DIVIDED DIFFERENCE FORMULA WAS PUT FORWARD TO OVERCOME A FEW LIMITATIONS OF LAGRANGE’S FORMULA. 

	IN  LAGRANGE'S FORMULA, IF ANOTHER INTERPOLATION VALUE WERE TO BE INSERTED, THEN THE INTERPOLATION 

	COEFFICIENTS WERE TO BE CALCULATED AGAIN.THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN DIVIDED DIFFERENCE.

	NEWTON'S DIVIDED DIFFERENCE FORMULA ELIMINATES THE DRAWBACK OF RECALCULATION AND RECOMPUTATION OF 

   	INTERPOLATION COEFFICIENTS BY USING NEWTON'S GENERAL INTERPOLATION FORMULA WHICH USES “DIVIDED DIFFERENCES”.

 	IF (x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2) ... BE GIVEN POINTS, THEN THE FIRST DIVIDED DIFFERENCE FOR THE ARGUMENTS

	 x0, x1 IS DEFINED AS:

 	[x0, x1] = (y1-y0)/(x1-x0). AND, SIMILARLY, [x1, x2] = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1), 
	
	AND AFTER THAT [x2, x3] = (y3-y2)/(x3-x2), AND SO ON.

	THE SECOND DIVIDED DIFFERENCE IS DEFINED AS: [x0, x1, x2] = ( [x1, x2] – [x0, x1] )/(x2-x0). 

	THIS GOES ON IN SIMILAR FASHION FOR THE THIRD, FOURTH ... AND nTH DIVIDED DIFFERENCES. 

	
        f(x) = f [x0] + (x - x0) f [x0, x1] + (x - x0) (x - x1) f [x0, x1, x2]+ . . . + (x - x0) (x - x1) . . . (x - xn-1) f [x0, x1, . . . ,xn].


	BASED ON THESE FORMULAS, TWO BASIC PROPERTIES OF NEWTON’S DIVIDED DIFFERENCE METHOD CAN BE OUTLINED AS GIVEN BELOW:
     	
	-	THE DIVIDED DIFFERENCES ARE SYMMETRICAL IN THEIR ARGUMENTS I.E. INDEPENDENT OF THE ORDER OF THE ARGUMENTS.
     	
	-  	THE NTH DIVIDED DIFFERENCES OF A POLYNOMIAL OF THE NTH DEGREE ARE CONSTANT.
