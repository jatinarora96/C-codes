	Newton-Raphson method, also known as the Newton's Method, is the simplest and fastest approach 
	
	to find the root of a function. It is an open bracket method and requires only one initial guess. 

	Newton’s method is often used to improve the result or value of the root obtained from other methods. 

	This method is more useful when the first derivative of f(x) is a large value.

	The convergence is the fastest of all the root finding methods discussed in Numerical Methods
