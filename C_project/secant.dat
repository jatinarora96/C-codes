						SECANT METHOD

	IT IS AN OPEN METHOD.IT STARTS WITH 2 INITIAL GUESSES AND HAS SUPER LINEAR CONVERGENCE.

	IT'S RATE OF CONVERGENCE IS FAST AND HAS GOOD ACCURACY.

	IT STARTS WITH

	SECANT METHOD IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO FIND THE ROOT OF A FUNCTION. IT IS BASED ON NEWTON-RAPHSON METHOD,

	AND BEING FREE FROM DERIVATIVE IT CAN BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NEWTON’S METHOD.

	THE SECANT METHOD IS FASTER THAN THE BISECTION METHOD AS WELL AS THE REGULA-FALSI METHOD. 
	
	THE RATE OF CONVERGENCE IS FAST; ONCE THE SECANT METHOD CONVERGES, ITS RATE OF CONVERGENCE IS 1.62, WHICH IS QUITE HIGH. 
	
	ALTHOUGH CONVERGENCE IS NOT GUARANTEED IN THIS METHOD, 

	THIS METHOD IS THE MOST ECONOMICAL ONE GIVING DEFINITELY RAPID RATE OF CONVERGENCE AT LOW COST.

	THE FORMULA IS GIVEN AS:
 			
			
                                 (xn - xn-1) f(xn)
                    xn+1 = xn - _________________
                                 f(xn) - f(xn-1)
