	INTERPOLATION IS THE PROCESS OF FINDING THE VALUES OF y CORRESPONDING TO THE ANY VALUE OF x BETWEEN x0 AND xn FOR 

	THE GIVEN VALUES OF y=F(x) FOR A SET OF VALUES OF x. 

	OUT OF THE MANY TECHNIQUES OF INTERPOLATION, NEWTON’S FORWARD AND BACKWARD INTERPOLATION ARE TWO VERY WIDELY USED FORMULAS. 

	BOTH OF NEWTON’S FORMULAS ARE BASED ON FINITE DIFFERENCE CALCULUS. 

	THESE FORMULAS ARE VERY OFTEN USED IN ENGINEERING AND RELATED SCIENCE FIELDS.
	
	NEWTON’S FORWARD INTERPOLATION FORMULA CONTAINS y0 AND THE FORWARD DIFFERENCES OF y0. 

	THIS FORMULA IS USED FOR INTERPOLATING THE VALUES OF y NEAR THE BEGINNING OF A SET OF TABULATED VALUES AND 

	EXTRAPOLATION THE VALUES OF y A LITTLE BACKWARD (I.E. TO THE LEFT) OF y0. 
 
	COMPARED TO FORWARD INTERPOLATION, THE BACKWARD INTERPOLATION FORMULA CONTAINS yn AND THE BACKWARD DIFFERENCES OF yn. 

	THIS FORMULA IS USED FOR INTERPOLATING THE VALUES OF y NEAR THE END OF A SET OF TABULATED VALUES AND ALSO FOR 

	EXTRAPOLATING THE VALUES OF y A LITTLE AHEAD (I.E. TO THE RIGHT) OF yn.
