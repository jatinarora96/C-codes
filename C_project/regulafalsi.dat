				REGULA FALSI METHOD

	Regula Falsi method, also known as the false position method, 

	is the oldest approach to find the real root of a function.
       
        It is a closed bracket method and closely resembles the bisection method.

	This method requires two initial guesses of opposite nature. 

	Like the secant method, interpolation is done to find the new values for successive iterations, 

	but in this method one interval always remains constant.

	The convergence is of first order and it is guaranteed. 

	In manual approach, the method of false position may be slow, 

	but it is found superior to the bisection method.
