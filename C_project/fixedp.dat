	Fixed point iteration method is commonly known as the iteration method. 

	It is one of the most common methods used to find the real roots of a function. 
	
	This method can be used for finding the solution of arithmetic series, geometric series, Taylor's series 

	and other forms of infinite series.This method is linearly convergent with somewhat slower rate of convergence, 

	similar to the bisection method. It is based on modification approach to find the fixed point. 

	It is commonly referred to as simple enclosure method or open bracket method.

	Just like the Newton Raphson method, it requires only one initial guess, and the equation is solved by 

	the assumed approximation.Iterations and modifications are successively continued with the updated 

	approximations of the guess. Iterative method gives good accuracy overall just like the other methods.
