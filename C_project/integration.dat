						        INTEGRATION

	



		We want to construct numerical algorithms that can perform definite integrals.

                        	              b 
                	                      |
		                          I = |f(x)dx --------> (I)
                                	      |
                                      	      a

		Calculating these definite integrals numerically is called numerical integration.

		The two oldest and most popular methods for approximating (I) are the TRAPIZOIDAL RULE and SIMPSON'S RULE.
