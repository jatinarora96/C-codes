						SIMPSON'S (1/3) RULE



	To obtain Simpson's rule, we combine the midpoint and trapezoidal rule to eliminate the error term proportional 

        to h^3.
         
	                                  h                         h^5
	                               I2=_(f(0) + 4f(h) + f(2h)) - ___ f''''(h) + . . .
