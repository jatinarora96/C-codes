	IF THE DATA SIZE IS BIG THEN THE DIVIDED DIFFERENCE TABLE WILL BE TOO LONG.

	SUPPOSE THE DESIRED INTERMEDIATE VALUE  {X} AT WHICH ONE NEEDS TO ESTIMATE THE FUNCTION  (I.E.F({X})) FALLS TOWARDS THE END OR 
	
	SAY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DATA SET THEN IT MAY BE BETTER TO START THE ESTIMATION PROCESS FROM THE LAST DATA SET POINT.

        FOR THIS WE NEED TO USE BACKWARD-DIFFERENCES AND BACKWARD DIFFERENCE TABLE. LET US FIRST DEFINE
 
	BACKWARD DIFFERENCES AND GENERATE BACKWARD DIFFERENCE TABLE, SAY FOR THE DATA SET  (X{i},F{i}),i=0,1,2,3,4.
 	
	                Pn(x) = c0 + c1(x - x0) + c2(x - x0)(x - x1) +    + cn(x - x0)    (x - xn-1),

	WHICH IS CLEARLY A POLYNOMIAL OF DEGREE n. THE n + 1 UNKNOWN COEFFICIENTS GIVEN BY

	THE c뭆 CAN BE FOUND BY SUBSTITUTING THE POINTS (xi, yi) FOR i = 0, . . . , n:

	y0 = c0,

	y1 = c0 + c1(x1 - x0),

	y2 = c0 + c1(x2 - x0) + c2(x2 - x0)(x2 - x1),
	.                  .                .
	.                  .                .
	.                  .                .

	yn = c0 + c1(xn - x0) + c2(xn - x0)(xn - x1) + . . . + cn(xn - x0) . . . (xn - xn-1).
