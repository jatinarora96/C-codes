	Parsing is done to evaluate a mathematical expression by breaking down the expression into small parts.
	
	There are many steps involved in parsing an expression.

	The expression is first broken into small pieces based on the operator ('+','-','*','/','(',')').

	Then as the expression is parsed(broken) it is indivisually evaluated.

	Then each value is put in a data structure called stack .

	The stack is then evaluated based on the operator.
 
	Parsing is applicable in all the areas where a mathematical expression is required to be evaluated in a fast 

	and effecient manner.

	The program written can parse the value of a fully parethised expression.
